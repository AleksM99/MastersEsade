# Lesson 2 - Python Exercises

This file, `Lesson2.py`, contains several Python exercises that build on basic programming concepts. Below is a breakdown of each exercise:

### Exercise 1: FizzBuzz
This exercise checks whether a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, by only 3, by only 5, or by neither, and prints the corresponding result:
- If divisible by both, it prints "FizzBuzz".
- If divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz".
- If divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz".
- Otherwise, it prints the number.

### Exercise 2: Filtering Integers from a List
This script filters out only the integer values from a mixed list of data types and creates a new list containing only those integers.

### Exercise 3: Simple To-Do List
A simple to-do list application that allows you to add tasks and view them. It utilizes a list to store tasks and functions to add and display them.

### Exercise 4: Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion
This function converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:  
`Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32`
It iterates through a list of Celsius values and prints their corresponding Fahrenheit equivalents.
